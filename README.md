# Used_Cars_Price_Prediction
Capstone project based on Machine Learnig / Reggresion

This project proposes to carry out a regression model that allows predicting the price of used
vehicles in India due to the great demand in the automotive market. Used vehicle data is
available, collecting information such as kilometers driven, engine power, location, type of
transmission, type of engine, owner number, among others. To obtain the model, different types
of supervised learning techniques are approached: linear regression, Ridge and Lasso
regularization, decision trees and Random Forest are explored, and through a comparison of
performance metrics (R squared and Root Mean Square Error) the model chosen to be adopt is
linear regression, given its high R squared in the test data, a low RMS value in both test and
training data, and the simplicity of the model that does not require large computational
calculations.
